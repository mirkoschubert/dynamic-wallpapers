# Dynamic Wallpapers

This is a collection of dynamic wallpapers for macOS Mojave or higher. If you have created a wallpaper yourself, please send me a memo, so I can add it as a submodule to my collection!

## Creation

I read the articles from [Marcin Czachurski](https://itnext.io/macos-mojave-dynamic-wallpaper-fd26b0698223) and used his tool [Wallpapper](https://github.com/mczachurski/wallpapper) to create the actual HEIC file. You can try this as well. It's pretty straight forward.

With the [Solar elevation angle calculator](https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1224682277) you can calculate the data which is needed for the JSON file. I strongly suggest to take pictures every 1.5 hours and calculate elevation and azimuth for your city at exactly these times. If you create images by yourself, you should take March 20 and start with exactly 12 AM. I used this method for my test image, but you have to adapt it to your location.

Have fun!
